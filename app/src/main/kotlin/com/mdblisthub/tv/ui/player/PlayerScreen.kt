 * fingertip first since that is what most of this app's testing has been on.
 *
 * Every OSD button — play, legenda, áudio, esticar — shares this one size, so
 * play does not read as more important than the controls beside it and the
 * row scans evenly left to right.
 *
 * Every property that changes with focus — scale, background, border —
 * animates on the same [FOCUS_TWEEN], so walking the row with left/right
 * reads as one continuous slide from button to button rather than a series
 * of snaps. `.scale()` is applied outside the `.size()`/`.clip()` chain
 * specifically so growing to 1.15x never breaks the circle back into an

/**
 * The whole subtitle-sync control: one bar, dragged with a finger — the

 * controller's direction keys for the rare tablet or docked-phone session
 * that has one attached.
 *
 * It replaced a row of −/reset/+/done buttons, the same as the TV build: four
 * targets to move one continuous value was already a lot of taps, and at
 * ±60s it stopped being viable at all.
 *
 * Every input path stays honest about precision:
 *
 * - **Touch drag** is absolute: the position of the finger *is* the value,
 *   read on every pointer move and snapped to the same 0.1s grid the keyed
 *   step uses, so a drag can still land exactly on zero. The very first touch
 *   (`awaitFirstDown`) already sets the value — there is no separate "tap to
 *   grab, then drag" step, which matters because [size] here — see
 *   `OSD_BUTTON_SIZE` — is a full fingertip while the visible track is a
 *   sliver; without an immediate jump-to-touch a first tap that lands
 *   slightly off the thin drawn track would feel like it missed.
 * - **A single key press** (external keyboard, game controller) moves exactly
 *   [SUBTITLE_OFFSET_STEP_MS] and fires inline in the key handler rather than
 *   from the effect below, because a press short enough to arrive and release
 *   inside one frame would otherwise be dropped: the effect's key would flip
 *   true and back to false with no recomposition in between, so it would
 *   never restart.
 * - **Holding** a key hands over to the effect, which keeps the fine step for
 *   half a second and then coarsens.
