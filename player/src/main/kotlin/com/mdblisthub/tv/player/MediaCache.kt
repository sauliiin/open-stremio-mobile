 * it re-fetches bytes the box already had, and a failover that retries the
 * same URL starts from zero.
 *

 * instance is pointed at a directory an existing one already holds, so this is

     * outage worth waiting through, and the quota below almost always binds
     * first on a real device. Raising it does not *reserve* anything; it only
