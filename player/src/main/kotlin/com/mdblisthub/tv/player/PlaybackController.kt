/**
 * Plays a title, deciding on its own which link to use — until it can't.
 *
 * The design rule this class serves: **the user does not pick a source while
 * automatic playback still has a chance.** They press play, and a queue of
 * candidates is walked until one produces a frame. A dead mirror, an expired
 * debrid token or a container the decoder chokes on are all the same event
 * here — move to the next one — and none of them is worth a dialog. Only once
 * every candidate has failed (see [fail]) is the same queue handed to the UI
 * as [PlaybackState.availableSources], so the user can try one by hand via
 * [playManual] — at that point automatic failover has already proven it
 * cannot decide for them.
 *
 * Candidates arrive as a [Flow] rather than a finished [List]: the repository
 * probes every mirror in parallel and hands each one over the moment it is
 * verified, so the first attempt can start while the rest are still being
 * checked. See [tryAdvance] for how the queue grows underneath an
 * already-running cascade.
 *
 * Success is defined as the player reaching `STATE_READY`, not as a command
 * being accepted — a 200-with-an-error-page opens a connection just as
 * readily as a real stream, but only a real one gets demuxed far enough to
 * report tracks and a duration.
 *
 * Every call here happens on the thread this was constructed on (the
 * ViewModel's main thread): ExoPlayer is single-threaded by contract, and
 * `viewModelScope` dispatches to Main, so the coroutines below stay on it.
