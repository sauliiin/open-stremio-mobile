/**
 * A [DefaultLoadControl] that reacts to the heap it is actually running on.
 *
 * Two things here cannot be expressed by `DefaultLoadControl` alone, which is
 * the whole reason this wrapper exists:
 *
 * 1. **The back buffer is a constructor constant there.** `LoadControl`
 *    declares `getBackBufferDurationUs` as a default method, so a wrapping
 *    implementation can vary it per call — which is what lets the back buffer
 *    stay a fixed *share* of the byte budget instead of a fixed number of
 *    seconds that happens to be enormous at high bitrate.
 * 2. **Nothing consults free memory.** The byte budget is fixed when the
 *    player is built, so a device that was comfortable at the start of a film
 *    has no way to give ground later.
 *
 * Every member is forwarded to [delegate] by hand rather than through Kotlin's
 * `by` interface delegation — deliberately, after that approach crashed real
 * playback. `by` only synthesises a forwarding override for members the
 * interface declares *abstract*; `LoadControl` has exactly one of those
 * (`getAllocator`), and everything else — `onPrepared`, `onTracksSelected`,
 * `retainBackBufferFromKeyframe`, `shouldStartPlayback`,
 * `shouldContinuePreloading` — is a Java 8 `default` method. For those, `by`
 * generates nothing, so a call landed on `LoadControl`'s own default body
 * instead of on `delegate`'s real implementation — which for
 * `retainBackBufferFromKeyframe` throws `IllegalStateException("...not
 * implemented")` unconditionally, and for the rest would have silently
 * skipped `DefaultLoadControl`'s actual buffer bookkeeping. Compiling clean
 * proved nothing here; only pressing play did.
 *
 * What this deliberately does *not* do is fight the delegate over
 * `Allocator.setTargetBufferSize`. `DefaultLoadControl` re-applies its own
 * target whenever tracks are selected, so a wrapper that also wrote there
 * would produce a value that silently reverts. Instead the budget is chosen
 * once, at construction, from measured headroom — and the only runtime lever
 * used is refusing to grow the buffer further when the heap gets tight, which
 * the delegate cannot override.
