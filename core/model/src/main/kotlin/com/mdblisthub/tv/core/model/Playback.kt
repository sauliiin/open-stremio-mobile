 * costs one slower resume and nothing else, which is what keeps them safe to
 * store in a cache that is thrown away on a schema change:
 *
 * - **[positionMs]**, because the provider only syncs a percentage. Turning
 *   that back into a position needs a runtime, and the only one available
 *   before the file is open is the metadata's, which routinely disagrees with
 *   the file by minutes. An exact position lets the very first range request
 *   land where the viewer left off, instead of landing near it and paying for
 *   a correction seek.
 * - **[sourceFilename]**, because resuming the release that already worked
 *   skips the cascade that found it, and hits a disk cache that is keyed by
 *   exactly this name. It also keeps the audio and subtitle tracks the viewer
 *   picked from changing under them between sessions.
 *
 * [durationMs] exists to place the other two on the provider's own scale, so
 * a session watched on another device can be told from this one's.
